        <article>The History of Gujarat is varied and unique. The first settlers in the state of Gujarat were Gurjaras
          who happened to be ethnic group of India. Be that as it may, the most punctual Archeological follows
          demonstrate the Indus Valley Civilization as verifiable relics with the Stone Age settlements are found in
          Gujarat around Sabarmati and Mahi streams.

          Its underlying foundations are additionally in the Harappan follows found at Lothal, Rampur, Amri and
          different spots. Ancient Gujarat was governed by the Maurya Dynasty. Ruler Chandragupta Maurya conquered
          various states in Gujarat while his grandson, King Ashoka broadened his area in Gujarat. The rules of the
          initial three Mauryas were noteworthy however with Ashoka's demise in 232 B C the Mauryan realm started to
          disintegrate, prompting political defragmentation. The Shungas who succeeded the Mauryas attempted,
          ineffectivelyto maintain the similarity to political solidarity.

          In 2001, after the loss of 2 assembly seats in by-decisions, Shri Keshubhai Patel surrendered and yielded
          capacity to Shri Narendra Modi. The BJP held a larger part in the 2002 political race, and Shri Narendra Modi
          has filled in as Chief Minister of the state since 7 October 2001 to 21st May 2014.</article>

      <div class="flex4-child">
        <article>The statue has been built as an ode to the Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the first home
          minister of independent India. He was responsible for uniting all 562 princely states of the country to build
          the Republic of India.
          October 31st, 2018, marked the inauguration of the world’s tallest statue – the Statue of Unity, against the
          backdrop of the dramatic Satpura and Vindhyachal hills in Kevadia, Gujarat. The 182-metre (600 feet aprox.)
          statue is dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the architect of independent India. The colossal monument
          towers over River Narmada, a tribute to India ‘from the people of Gujarat’ to the leader who placed people’s
          welfare first. The Statue of Unity overlooks the vast surrounds and the river basin of the Narmada River and
          the sprawling Sardar Sarovar dam. It stands on the Sadhu Bet hillock, connected by a 300-metre bridge, which
          offers access from the mainland to the statue.
          As a part of an outreach programme for the project, the state government had asked Indian farmers to donate
          their used farming equipment to collect iron needed for the statue of Sardar Patel. Eventually, about 5000
          tonnes of iron is believed to be collected. Details of the construction and history of the leader can be seen
          in an in-house museum, inside the statue.

          The Sardar Sarovar Dam is the third highest concrete dam (163 metres) in India after Bhakra (226 metres) in
          Himachal Pradesh and Lakhwar (192 metres) in Uttar Pradesh. In terms of volume of concrete involved for
          gravity dams, this dam is ranked as the second largest in the world with an aggregate volume of 6.82 million
          cubic metre; only after Grand Coulee Dam in the USA with a total volume of 8.0 million cubic metre being the
          largest.

    <div id="headline">Glory of Somnath Mandir</div>
    <div id="flex5">

      <div class="flex5-child">
        <article>The intricately carved honey-coloured Somnath temple on the western edge of the state is believed to be
          the place where the first of the twelve holy jyotirlingas emerged in India – a spot where Shiva appeared as a
          fiery column of light. The temples lies at the meeting of Kapila, Hiran and Sarasvati rivers and the waves of
          the Arabian Sea ebb and flow touching the shore on which it is constructed. The ancient temple’s timeline can
          be traced from 649 BC but is believed to be older than that. The present form was reconstructed in 1951.
          Colourful dioramas of the Shiva story line the north side of the temple garden, though it’s hard to see them
          through the hazy glass. A one-hour sound-and-light show in Amitabh Bachchan’s baritone highlights the temple
          nightly at 7.45pm.
          It’s said that Somraj (the moon god) first built a temple in Somnath, made of gold; this was rebuilt by Ravana
          in silver, by Krishna in wood and by Bhimdev in stone. The current serene, symmetrical structure was built to
          traditional designs on the original coastal site: it’s painted a creamy colour and boasts a little fine
          sculpture. The large, black Shiva lingam at its heart is one of the 12 most sacred Shiva shrines, known as
          jyotirlinga.

        </article>
        <br>
        <article>
          A description of the temple by Al-Biruni, an Arab traveller, was so glowing that it prompted a visit in 1024
          by a most unwelcome tourist – the legendary looter Mahmud of Ghazni from Afghanistan. At that time, the temple
          was so wealthy that it had 300 musicians, 500 dancing girls and even 300 barbers. Mahmud of Ghazni took the
          town and temple after a two-day battle in which it’s said 70,000 defenders died. Having stripped the temple of
          its fabulous wealth, Mahmud destroyed it. So began a pattern of destruction and rebuilding that continued
          forcenturies. The temple was again razed in 1297, 1394 and finally in 1706 by Aurangzeb, the Mughal ruler.
          After that, the temple wasn’t rebuilt until 1950. The best time to visit Somnath Temple is in the cooler
          months of October to February, though the site is open all through the year. Shivratri (usually in February or
          March) and Kartik Purnima (close to Diwali) are celebrated with great enthusiasm here.</article>

      <div class="flex7-child">
        <article> This sacred mountain also known as Revatak Parvata, rising dramatically from the plains, is covered
          with Jain and Hindu temples. Pilgrims from far and wide come to tackle the long climb up 10,000 stone steps to
          the summit, which is best begun at dawn. Be prepared to spend a full day if you want to reach the uppermost
          temples. Ascending in the early morning light is a magical experience, as pilgrims and porters trudge up the
          steps.The Jain temples, a cluster of mosaic-decorated domes interspersed with elaborate stupas, are about
          two-thirds of the way up. The largest and oldest is the 12th-century Temple of Neminath, dedicated to the 22nd
          Tirthankar: go through the first left-hand doorway after the first gate. Many temples are locked from around
          11 am to 3 pm, but this one is open all day. The nearby triple Temple of Mallinath, dedicated to the ninth

          four peaks and further temples. The Temple of Gorakhnath is perched on Gujarat’s highest peak at 1117m. The

        <article> Kankaria lake can be found in the south-eastern section of Ahmedabad near the Maninagar area, in
          Gujrat. It is said to be the second largest lake in the city. Multiple tourist spots like the zoo, kids city,
          toy-train, hot-air balloon ride, water-based rides and other such entertainment attractions are in abundance
          in the lakefront that has been developed around Kankaria lake. However, it wasn’t like this since the
          beginning.The construction of the lake was done by some of the finest Mughal architects of the time as evident
          from the different cuttings and designs in the stones that have been employed to construct the polygonal
          shaped reservoir that resides right in the middle of this lake.Kankaria lake consists of an island that
          encompasses Nagina Wadi, which is a garden, right in the middle of it. This place in itself is a beautiful
          tourist spot here. Nagina means jewel here. The garden further consists of a summer palace which goes by the
          name of Ghattamandal.A bridge connects with the bank that was originally 48 arches long. Many have mentioned
          this kind of architecture as a magnificent piece of the Mughal era, and just like a centre piece in jewellery,
          it is also known as the centre jewel of the lake.

        <article>
          The actual origin for the name Kankaria is unknown, yet various stories roam about. One of them says that the
          name Kankaria was chosen due to the huge piles of limestone that was dug out during its excavation for
          formation of the artificial lake.
          Another story says that Sultan Qutb-ud-Din had posed a question to Shah Alam, who was a saint, to select a
          location for the garden and the tank, who then scattered pebbles and built the lake, thereby owing the name
          Kankaria lake.There are numerous attractions to enjoy at Kankaria lake. From zoos and parks to different kinds
          of rides, this place demands at least a couple hours of your time to enjoy it heartily.

          The Kankaria Zoo is easily one of the top most visited tourist destinations in Kankaria lake. Some may wonder
          what's so special about this just-another zoo? Well, this zoo was once the best rated zoo in the whole of
          Asia. It cages various varieties and species of animals including reptiles,mammals, carnivores and predators.
          Children and adults alike are sure to learn many things about the animals present here through the tour that’s

    <div id="headline">Akshar Dham</div>
    <div id="flex9">

      <div class="flex9-child">
        <article> 'Akshardham' literally means the divine abode of God. It is an eternal place for one to offer devotion
          and experience everlasting peace. Swaminarayan Akshardham at Gandhinagar is a mandir – a Hindu house of
          worship, a dwelling place for God, and a spiritual and cultural campus dedicated to devotion, education and
          unification. Timeless devotional messages and vibrant Hindu traditions are echoed in its art and architecture.
          The mandir is a humble tribute to Bhagwan Swaminarayan (1781- 1830) and the avatars, devas and sages of
          Hinduism. This traditionally-styled complex was inaugurated on October 30th, 1992 with the blessings of HH
          Pramukh Swami Maharaj and through the devoted efforts of skilled artisans and volunteers.
          
        </article>
        <br>
        <article>
          Each element of Akshardham echoes with spirituality – the mandir, the exhibitions and even the gardens. The
          Akshardham mandir has over two hundred murtis (idols), representing spiritual stalwarts from over many
          millennia. The spiritual premise of Akshardham is that each soul is potentially divine. Whether we are serving
          the family, our neighbors, the country, or people all around the world, each act of kindness can help one move
          towards divinity. Each prayer is an endeavor in self-improvement and a step closer to God.
          A visit to Akshardham is an enriching experience. Whether it is in realizing the power of prayer, in feeling
          the strength of non-violence, in becoming aware of the universal nature of Hinduism’s ancient principles, or
          just in admiring the beauty of God’s abode on Earth – each element has a resounding significance.
